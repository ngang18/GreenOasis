# GreenOasis - Introduction
This is a group project for the course E-Commerce Application Development, developed by Group 2. The goal is to build a complete e-commerce website with both a modern frontend interface and a fully functional backend system.
- The frontend is built using the Botanical HTML5 eCommerce Template, offering a clean, modern, and user-friendly design focused on enhancing the shopping experience.
- The backend follows the tutorial series from JahirTech YouTube Channel, developed with .NET Core and Entity Framework, providing secure and efficient data handling.
The main objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience in designing, developing, and deploying an e-commerce application â€” applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios across frontend UI design, backend development, and database management.

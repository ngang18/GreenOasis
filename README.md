# GreenOasis - Introduction
This is a group project for the course E-Commerce Web Development, developed by Group 2.

- The frontend is built using the Botanical HTML5 eCommerce Template (https://elements.envato.com/botanical-html5-ecommerce-template-TGMD7D6)
- The backend follows the tutorial series from JahirTech YouTube Channel, developed with .NET Core and Entity Framework, providing secure and efficient data handling (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRZxInSY21u00HJH44cGhCe72KfZstqgH)

The main objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience in designing, developing, and deploying an e-commerce application â€” applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios across frontend UI design, backend development, and database management.
